Media Product Inventory - Assignment 3 for CS 3330 (Object Oriented Programming) at the University of Missouri
Written in: Java

This repository consists of a MediaProduct class and various related subclasses. It reads in type, title, price, year, and genre of each product from a csv file. The csv file we based our testing on can be found in the "files" folder.
The main classes are MediaProduct and StockManagerSingleton. Subclasses that extend MediaProduct include VinylRecordProduct, TapeRecordProduct, and CDRecordProduct.
Methods of the "boolean" return type generally return true for success and false if something went wrong. 
The Main.java file provides a possible way to use the classes and associated methods, and tests all of the methods implemented.

The purpose of this project was to practice reading from a file and to gain a better understanding of super and sub classes as part of an introductory course to Java and Object Oriented Programming.
